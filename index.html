          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>To some extent, income and wealth directly support better health because wealthier people can afford
            the resources that protect and improve health. In contrast to many low-income people, they tend to have
            jobs that are more stable and flexible; provide good benefits, like paid leave, health insurance, and worksite
            wellness programs; and have fewer occupational hazards. More affluent people have more disposable
            income and can more easily afford medical care and a healthy lifestyle—benefits that also extend to
            their children.
            Lower-Income Americans Are Less Able to Afford
            Health Care Services and Health Insurance
            People with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care, are more likely to be
            uninsured or underinsured, and face greater financial barriers to affording deductibles, copayments, and

            the costs of medicines and other health care expenses. Conditions may change under the Affordable Care
            Act, but as of 2011 the probability of being uninsured before age 65 was 28.4 percent for those living in
            poverty, 16.5 percent for those with incomes two to three times the FPL, and 5.2 percent for those with
            incomes four or more times the FPL.15
            Partly because of reduced access to care and reduced affordability, low-income patients are less likely to
            receive recommended health care services, such as cancer screening tests and immunizations. For example,
            in 2012 the proportion of adults ages 50 to 75 who reported never having been screened for colorectal
            cancer was 19.5 percent for those with annual household incomes of $75,000 or more but 42.5 percent for
            those with incomes below $15,000.16
            In 2011, almost one-quarter (23.3 percent) of adults with family incomes under $35,000 per year had no
            usual place of medical care, compared with 6.0 percent of those with incomes of $100,000 or higher.11
            Similarly, 22.6 percent reported not having seen a dentist in more than five years, compared with 4.3
            percent of adults with family incomes over $100,000.11</p>
